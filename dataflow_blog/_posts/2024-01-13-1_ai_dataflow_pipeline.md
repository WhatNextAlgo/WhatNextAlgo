### **Objective**

The goal of this project is to create a robust AI dataflow pipeline that efficiently loads data from multiple sources, such as ADLS Gen2 and Azure SQL Database, and seamlessly writes it to an AI workstation based on a specified AI column mapping.

### **Required Azure Services and Compute Engine**

1. **ADLS Gen2 / Azure SQL Database**: The pipeline leverages the capabilities of Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and Azure SQL Database for data storage and retrieval.

2. **Azure Databricks**: We utilize Azure Databricks as our data processing engine, enabling us to mount multiple ADLS Gen2 storage accounts to access blob storage efficiently.

3. **Azure Data Factory / Azure Databricks Workflow**: To orchestrate the data flow, Azure Data Factory or Azure Databricks Workflow comes into play, providing a streamlined pipeline for data movement and transformation.

### **Implementation Steps**

#### Step 1: Mounting ADLS Gen2 in Azure Databricks

We initiate the data pipeline by mounting multiple ADLS Gen2 storage accounts in Azure Databricks, ensuring seamless access to blob storage.

#### Step 2: Configuration Table Setup

A configuration table is established to store metadata essential for the pipeline. This includes details such as module location/path, module name, submodule name, client code for partitioning, an active flag, and product code.

#### Step 3: Column Mapping and Semantic Model Merge

Leveraging an AI mapping sheet, the pipeline dynamically looks up column names in respective semantic models, fetching the necessary data. The retrieved semantic models from different products are then merged to form a consolidated dataset.

#### Step 4: Writing to AI Workstation Blob Storage

The final step involves writing the merged semantic model to the AI workstation's blob storage. This ensures that the data is readily available for AI model training and analysis.

### **Optimization Strategies**

To enhance efficiency, the pipeline employs concurrency for parallel data writing. This optimization is achieved by parallelizing data writes based on partitioning by module name and client code.

### **Notification and Reporting**

The pipeline is designed to generate comprehensive notification emails. These emails include success metrics and detailed failure metrics, providing insights into any errors encountered. The notifications are sent to the respective teams associated with each error, facilitating swift issue resolution.

In conclusion, this AI dataflow pipeline not only streamlines the process of loading and merging data but also emphasizes optimization and robust reporting, ensuring a smooth and transparent data processing workflow.
